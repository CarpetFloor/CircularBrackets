Custom brackets challenge.<br>
[circularbrackets.com](https://www.circularbrackets.com)

Primarily designed for mobile first, but does still work and look alright on desktop devices.<br>
Designed for a format of 4 rounds, with 4, 4, 2, and 1 games per round. Can be changed, but is largely an issue for the front-end needing to be reworked, as the results file can be formatted any way.
#
- Can define team matchups and results in Data/Global/Results.json
